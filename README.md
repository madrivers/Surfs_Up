# Surfs_Up Challenge
---
## Overview
This analysis was commissioned in order to understand the varying weather patterns (Temperature, percipitation, etc.) on an island of Hawaii where we wanted to opnn a surf & ice cream shop.  This data woudld be leveraged to address potential weather risk to the success of the business.

## Results
### June vs,. December Weather
In this challge the goal was to evaluate the weather at the peak of summer and the peak of winter in order to address variablility

June (Peak of Summer)

## Summary
The mean temperature difference between June and December is only 4 degrees (~75 degrees vs. ~71 degrees).  This variance should not greatly impact the ability to either sur or the desire to consume ice cream.  

The max temperature is even less remarkable, being only 2 degrees differnt between June and December.

The minimum temperature is the largest issue, going from 64 degrees in June to 56 degrees in December.  The December low, may not lend itself for ice cream consumption or even surfing.  That said, its likely that this low tempearature is achieved over night, when these activities are both in low demand.

With a standard deviation between 3 and 4 in each analysis, the numbers observed over 1,500 obervations in both cases, appear to be stable and do not fluctuatte greatly.

More telling queries may include the time of day when temeratures are achieved and the amount of precipitation that is received in each of the time periods.  If there is a way to measure surf conditions that may add additional insight to this analysis.
